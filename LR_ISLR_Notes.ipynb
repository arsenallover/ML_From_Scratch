    "__Error Term__          \n",
    "The error term is the catch-all for what all we miss with this model:     \n",
    "    1. The true Relationship may not be linear          \n",
    "    2. There may be other variables that cause variation in Y that is not included.             \n",
    "    3. There may be measurement error \n",
    "    4. it is typically normal distribution with mean zero.          \n",
    "True Relationship is not known/unobserved and least sqaures can be the approxmiation.\n",

    "__Sample & Population__:            \n",
    "Sample mean $({\\hat \\mu})$ is mean of a sample. Depending on the particular set of observations, it can either underestimate or overestimate the Population mean ($\\mu$). So we can average a huge number of sample means that would be very close of Population mean.\n",

    "_Standard Error_        \n",
    "How accurate is ${\\hat \\mu}$ to ${\\mu}$ ?\n",
    "$$ Var(\\hat \\mu) = SE(\\hat\\mu)^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} $$\n",
    "$\\sigma$ is std dev of each realizations of $y_i$ of Y. $\\underline{(_NotClear_)}$  \n",
    "The deviation shrinks with n (more observations). In similar way, we can obtain SE of m, c:\n",
    "$$ SE(m)^2 = \\sigma^2( \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar x^2}{\\sum(x_i - \\bar x)^2}) $$\n",
    "$$ SE(c)^2 =  \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sum(x_i - \\bar x)^2} $$\n",
    "where $\\sigma^2$ is Var(Error) ! How do i calculate that? Thats why i chose to calculate SE(m,c) through another formula using matrix inversions."
