    "* Technique used to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, called outliers\n",
    "* Use cases\n",
    "    * Fraud detection\n",
    "    * Intrusion detection\n",
    "    * System health monitoring\n",
    "* Types:\n",
    "    * **Point anomalies**: A single instance of data is anomalous if it's too far off from the rest. Business use case: Detecting credit card fraud based on \"amount spent.\"\n",
    "    * **Contextual anomalies**: The abnormality is context specific. This type of anomaly is common in time-series data. Business use case: Spending Rs. 100 on food every day during the holiday season is normal, but may be odd otherwise.\n",
    "    * **Collective anomalies** : A set of data instances collectively helps in detecting anomalies. Business use case: Someone is trying to copy data form a remote machine to a local host unexpectedly, an anomaly that would be flagged as a potential cyber attack.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Novelty Vs Anomaly Detection\n",
    "* Novelty: training data is not polluted by outliers, and we are interested in detecting anomalies in new observations.\n",
    "* Anomaly: training data contains outliers, and we need to fit the central mode of the training data, ignoring the deviant observations"
