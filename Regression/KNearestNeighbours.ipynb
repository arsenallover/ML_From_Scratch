    "Consider x and y where the relationship is not clear that initially it is linear, midway it constant and towards end it is quadratic. It is difficult to model these changing behaviour well through linear regression. Polynomial regression could capture them, but again at the extent of high variance.\n",

    "Hence, KNN type of non-parametric approaches work well in such scenario.\n"
